# DockerPi Power Board - Hack

This is a firmware hack made for the DockerPi PowerBoard an usefoul addon for the raspberry PI easely available online from Amazon, Ebay and others.
More information about DockerPi PowerBoard can be found at https://wiki.52pi.com/index.php/DockerPi_PowerBoard_SKU:_EP-0104

The standard software it is shipped with does not allows the direct startup of the RaspberryPi when the power is connected to the input jack, this sometime is not the desired behaviour.
I was not able to find more information about this board online and I decided to reverse engeneer it and write a new version of firmware with ChibiOS.

Here you can find the firmware and some notes.
